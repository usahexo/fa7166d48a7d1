#  Hollywood Casino to Bet on Sports Gambling

 Hollywood Casino is planning to enter the sports gambling market, following in the footsteps of Pennsylvania’s SugarHouse, which began taking sports bets earlier this year.

Pennsylvania is one of several states where sports betting is now legal after a 2018 US Supreme Court ruling that overturned a federal law prohibiting it.

Hollywood Casino spokesman, Brucie Lewis, said that the casino plans to offer in-game and pre-game bets on professional and college sporting events. He added that the casino has worked with Pennsylvania’s Gaming Control Board to get approval for its plans.

It is not clear when Hollywood Casino will begin taking sports bets, but Lewis said that the casino plans to have a mobile app available for customers who want to bet on sporting events away from the casino.

The move into sports gambling by Hollywood Casino comes as casinos nationwide are looking for new ways to bring in revenue since revenues from traditional gambling games such as slots and blackjack have slowed.

Sports betting is seen as a potential growth area for casinos because it is popular with younger gamblers who are increasingly using mobile devices to place their bets. In fact, a study by gaming research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming found that nearly 60 percent of US adults would be interested in betting on sports if it were legal in their state.

#  Hollywood Casino to Add Sports Betting

On Tuesday, it was announced that Hollywood Casino in Columbus, Ohio would be adding sports betting to its offerings. The addition is expected to be completed in time for the start of the NFL season in September.

In order to make use of the new sports betting service, customers will need to present a photo ID and have a valid Hollywood Casino player’s card. Bettors will then be able to place bets on games both in-person and online.

This is not the first casino in Ohio to add sports betting; both Scioto Downs and Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park offer the same service. However, Hollywood Casino is the only one with a license to offer internet betting.

Sports betting has been making headlines all over the country lately. In May, the US Supreme Court struck down a law that had prohibited states from legalizing sports betting. Since then, a number of states have moved to legalize it.

Ohio was among those states; Governor John Kasich signed a bill into law legalizing sports betting in June. However, there are still some regulations that need to be put into place before it can officially go into effect. These regulations include fees that casinos will have to pay for licensing and oversight, as well as how much tax revenue will be generated from sports betting.

It is still unclear exactly when these regulations will be finalized and sports betting will become available in Ohio casinos. For now, Hollywood Casino is the only one with a confirmed launch date for its new sportsbook.

#  Hollywood Casino Announces Plans for Sports Betting

In a move that is sure to excite gamblers and sports fans alike, Hollywood Casino has announced plans to offer sports betting. This will make Hollywood Casino the first casino in Pennsylvania to offer this popular form of gambling.

Sports betting is a type of wagering where gamblers place bets on the outcomes of sporting events. It can be done at casinos, racetracks, or through online betting sites. In recent years, sports betting has become increasingly popular, thanks in part to the growth of internet gambling.

Hollywood Casino's decision to offer sports betting comes as no surprise. In 2017, Pennsylvania passed a bill that legalized sports betting. The bill allows casinos in the state to offer sports betting, but they are not required to do so. So far, only two casinos have announced plans to offer sports betting: Hollywood Casino and Penn National Gaming.

Penn National Gaming is planning to launch its sports betting operation in October 2018. Hollywood Casino's plan is a little more ambitious; they are aiming for a November 2018 launch. This gives them plenty of time to get everything in order.

What's interesting about Hollywood Casino's plans is that they are not just focusing on football. They are also planning to offer bets on basketball, baseball, and other sporting events. This is in contrast to Penn National Gaming, which is only focusing on football bets.

It will be interesting to see how Hollywood Casino's gamble pays off. Offering sports betting could help them attract new customers and boost profits. But it could also lead to an increase in gambling addiction problems. Only time will tell how this plays out.

#  How Will Hollywood Casino's Move to Sports Betting Affect the Gaming Industry?

Recently, Hollywood Casino announced their plans to move into the sports betting industry. This move could have a significant impact on the gaming industry as a whole.

Hollywood Casino's entrance into the sports betting market is likely to cause some of the other major casinos in the country to follow suit. This could lead to an increase in sports betting revenue overall. In fact, it's been estimated that the sports betting market could be worth as much as $150 billion.

This is good news for Hollywood Casino, which has been struggling in recent years. The company has been dealing with increasing competition from other casinos and online gambling platforms. Sports betting could be just what they need to stay competitive.

Not only is this move good for Hollywood Casino, but it could also benefit consumers as well. With more competition in the sports betting market, we can expect to see better deals and offerings from the different casinos. This will be especially true if Hollywood Casino's entrance into the market causes some of the smaller casinos to fold.

Overall, Hollywood Casino's move into the sports betting industry is likely to be good for both them and consumers alike. We can expect to see more competition and better deals in the coming years.

#  What Impact Will Hollywood Casino's Entry into Sports Betting Have on Penn National Gaming

On October 5th, 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in their quest to legalize sports betting. This ruling overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992, a law that essentially banned sports betting outside of Nevada. The flood gates are now open for other states to legalize sports gambling, and one of the first out of the gate is Penn National Gaming.

Penn National Gaming owns and operates 40 properties across the US and Canada, including Hollywood Casino in Grantville, Pennsylvania. On November 1st, 2018, Hollywood Casino announced that they will be offering sports betting at their property starting on November 14th. This move by Penn National is a clear statement that they intend to be a major player in the sports betting market.

So what impact will Hollywood Casino's entry into sports betting have on Penn National Gaming? There are a couple of potential ramifications:

1. Increased revenue from casino gambling - In general, casinos make more money when they offer gambling on sports matches. This is because people who bet on sports tend to also place bets on casino games. Therefore, by adding sports betting to its offerings, Hollywood Casino can expect to see an increase in revenue from casino gambling.

2. Decreased revenue from lottery ticket sales - With the legalization of sports betting, people will no longer need to buy lottery tickets in order to bet on sporting events. This could lead to a decrease in revenue for state lotteries, which is bad news for organizations like the Pennsylvania Lottery Commission that rely on these revenues to fund various programs.

3. More competition for casinos - With sports betting now legal in Pennsylvania, other casinos in the state will likely start offering it as well. This will increase competition for Hollywood Casino, which may lead to lower profits or even losses.

4. Positive economic impact - While there may be some negative consequences for Penn National Gaming from Hollywood Casino's entry into sports betting, there are also likely to be some positive effects. For example, the increased revenue from casino gambling could lead to more jobs being created and/or higher wages for existing employees. Additionally, the legalization of sports betting could lead to an overall increase in tourism activity (and tax revenue) in Pennsylvania.
