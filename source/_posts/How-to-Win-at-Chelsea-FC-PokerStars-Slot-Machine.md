Chelsea FC poker fans were elated earlier this year when news of a new partnership between the club and PokerStars was announced. The collaboration will see the world’s largest online poker site become the exclusive global shirt sponsor of the club.

With excitement mounting for the upcoming Premier League season, we take a look at some of the best strategies for playing Chelsea FC slots on PokerStars.
