#  You're Never too Old to Play at Seminole Casino AC Milan
 injury crisis has seen the club turn to the transfer market in order to sign a winger. And, while there are many players who could fit into that role, the Rossoneri have zeroed in on 41-year-old veteran Clarence Seedorf.
The Dutchman is currently a free agent after leaving Chinese side Shenzhen FC at the end of the 2016 season and his signing would certainly be considered a publicity stunt by Milan, with captain Leonardo Bonucci even admitting that "age is just a number."
But, while it's easy to write off Seedorf's potential move to the San Siro as nothing more than a gimmick, he could actually provide some very real value to the team.

In an interview with Fox Sports Netherlands, Seedorf outlined why he believes he can still be a valuable asset for Milan: "I'm not coming here for charity. I think I can still make a contribution both on and off the pitch. I'm in good shape and I still have something to offer."
While his time in China may not have been all that successful – he only managed five appearances in all competitions – there's no doubt that Seedorf is a hugely experienced player who could be a valuable mentor to Milan's younger stars.

In addition, he also has plenty of know-how when it comes to European football having won league titles in three different countries (Netherlands, Spain and Italy). And, with Milan currently seventh in Serie A, they could certainly use all the help they can get as they look to qualify for next season's Champions League. 
Even if Seedorf isn't able to make much of an impact on the pitch himself, his presence alone could be invaluable in terms of team morale and unity. As captain of both Ajax and Real Madrid during his playing career, Seedorf knows how to lead by example and inspire others around him. 

So, while some may see his signing as nothing more than a publicity stunt, there's no doubt that Clarence Seedorf could still bring plenty of value to AC Milan.
