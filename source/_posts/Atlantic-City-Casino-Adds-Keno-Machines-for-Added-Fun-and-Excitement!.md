#  Atlantic City Casino to Add More Than 100 Keno Machines!

The Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City is set to add more than 100 new keno machines to its gambling floor in the coming weeks. The expansion is part of a larger effort by the casino to lure in more gamblers and boost revenue.

Keno is a lottery game that has been around for centuries. It is similar to bingo, but players instead select numbers and wait for them to be drawn randomly from a pool. The game became popular in the United States in the early 20th century, and it remains a staple of casino gambling today.

The Tropicana Casino has been investing heavily in its keno offerings in recent years. In addition to the new machines, the casino has also introduced several new jackpots and betting options. It now offers players the chance to bet on individual numbers, as well as groups of numbers, making the game more exciting and strategic.

The decision to add more keno machines comes at a time when Atlantic City casinos are struggling to compete with casinos in other states. In 2017, gaming revenue in Atlantic City was down by nearly 10 percent compared to 2016. The Tropicana Casino hopes that its new keno offering will help turn things around.

The addition of more than 100 keno machines will make the Tropicana Casino one of the largest gambling destinations in Atlantic City. It will also give players more choices when it comes to types of games available at the casino.
