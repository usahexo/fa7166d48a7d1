#  Star Casino Dumas Moving This Weekend

The Star Casino in Dumas is moving this weekend. The casino has been in its current location for over a decade, but it will be moving to a new location on the edge of town.

The new location is much larger, and it will feature new games and a larger casino floor. In addition, the new location will have a hotel and conference center.

Gaming industry experts are predicting that the new casino will be a big success. They believe that the larger space and added amenities will attract even more visitors to the casino.

The Star Casino Dumas is one of the oldest casinos in the state. It first opened its doors over thirty years ago. In recent years, however, it has become overshadowed by newer casinos in the area.

With the move to the new location, the casino is hoping to regain its former glory. The owners believe that the added features will make it stand out from the competition.

#  Star Casino Dumas Relocating To A Larger Facility

The Star Casino Dumas is relocating to a larger facility. The new casino will be three times the size of the current one and will include a hotel, conference center, and additional gaming options.

The move is in response to increased customer demand. The current casino has become too small to handle the crowds, especially on busy weekends.

The new location will be in the heart of the city and offer excellent access to the casino floor, hotel rooms, and other amenities. It is expected to create hundreds of jobs in the area.

Construction is already underway and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.
